# Pizza-Ordering-Python
100 DoC Python Day 3 Project: Pizza Ordering Interface
### This Python program does the following:
1. Takes user input for the size of pizza they want to order
2. Takes user input for whether if they want extra toppings for their pizza
3. Uses if/elif statements to print the total bill based on their input, from an already defined price list
